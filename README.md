## How It's Made:

This is my second attempt on creating a simple app with API integration 

## Optimizations

I encountered many errors when trying to implement the interactive dev_ethos logo at the beginning. This was the first time that I had to do research on stackoverflow to solve these issues. Google has always been one of my 'best friends". At the end, we had to extend a little the loading animation of the site for the logo to load before everything else loads. 

## Lessons Learned:

I realized how important it is to ask for help instead of trying to solve everything on your own. I understand now that having this approach to these situations will have a positive impact in the long run for me and everyone involved in the project.
