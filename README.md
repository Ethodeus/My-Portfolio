## How It's Made:

This is my first online portfolio, I really focused on the separation of concerns by ensuring that I was only dedicating the HTML to holding content, the CSS to holding styling and the JavaScript to holding any behavioural interactions.

## Optimizations

I encountered many errors when trying to implement the interactive dev_ethos logo at the beginning. This was the first time that I had to do research on stackoverflow to solve these issues. Google has always been one of my 'best friends". Finally, I extended the loading time of the animation to allow the logo to load before everything else.

## Lessons Learned:

I realized how important it is to ask for help instead of trying to solve everything on your own. I understand now that having this approach to these situations will have a positive impact in the long run for me and everyone involved in the project.Â
